<h3>A Rebel By Any Other Name</h3>
<p>Winston Smith is pretty much your average guy. He's 39 years old and works as a records editor in Records Department at the Ministry of Truth. He drinks and <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/analysis/symbolism-imagery-allegory"">smokes</a> (this was <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/analysis/writing-style"">written in the 1940's</a>, mind you), and has terrible coughing fits in the morning. Maybe he should lay off the cigs. Other ""fun"" facts about Winston: He hates group exercise, he has an itchy swollen <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/analysis/symbolism-imagery-allegory"">ulcer</a> on his leg (gross), and he likes to write.</p>
<p>If it sounds like we just described that one weird and kind-of-boring uncle of yours—hurray! That's exactly the point. Winston is supposed to be <em>relatable</em>—someone we can identify and sympathize with. Orwell made Winston such an average Joe to help us see ourselves—or someone we know—in his shoes, experiencing the future in all its mundane, oppressive brutality. This makes his journey all the more powerful, and his downfall all the more tragic. </p>

<h3>The Future's So Dull, We Have to Wear Blue Onesies</h3>
<p>Winston is a <em>man of the future</em>. Unfortunately, the future isn't all that great. Rather than possessing bionic arms and super-senses, Winston is frail and thin. He wears blue overalls and eats gross-sounding synthetic foods like black bread, bitter chocolate, and fake saccharine. We're not sure if we should be impressed or concerned that all three of these foods exist today.</p>
<p>Winston is an Outer Party member, which is basically this story's version of a middle class. As a records editor at the <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/quotes/language-and-communication"">Ministry of Truth</a>, his job is to <em>literally</em> rewrite history, revising old newspaper articles so they're in line with the Party's current vision of the truth. The original articles are tossed in an incinerator, never to be seen again. We wonder what the Party would be so worried about people learning that they'd go to this length to cover their tracks, but then again, freedom of the press isn't exactly the norm in a <em>dystopian</em> society.</p>
<h3>He's Not Gonna Take It</h3>
<p>A lonely and observant intellect, Winston is resentful of the Party’s oppression of, um, <em>everything under the sun</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>He felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world where he himself was the monster. He was alone. The past was dead, the future was unimaginable. What certainty had he that a single human creature now living was on his side? And what way of knowing that the dominion of the Party would not endure forever? </em>(1.2.34)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He spends much of his time jotting down what he learns about the real past and musing on his rebellious tendencies in a secret journal he keeps in an alcove in his room that escapes the watchful surveillance of the <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/quotes/technology-and-modernization"">telescreen</a>. <span class=""wtf"" data-wtf=""4DE23C1AD2CA44FCA87CEFD0868FF8E0"">He also enjoys strolling in the prole district, looking for connections to the past, Piña Coladas, and getting caught in the rain</span>.</p>
<p>More than anything, Winston seeks the unadulterated truth—and the only way to attain that is by rebelling against the totalitarian rule of the Party:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Anything that hinted at corruption always filled him with a wild hope. Who knew, perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface, its cult of strenuousness and self denial simply a sham concealing iniquity. If he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Anything to rot, to weaken, to undermine!</em> (2.2.54-55, Winston)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the moment he starts the journal to his first encounter with <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/obrien"">O’Brien</a>, Winston holds on to his dream of freedom and independence. Some of the more steamy acts of rebellion occur when Winston gets jiggy with Julia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>She stood looking at him for an instant, then felt at the zipper of her overalls. And, yes! It was almost as in his dream. Almost as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had torn her clothes off, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated.</em> (2.2.47)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well. We'll have what they're having.</p>
<h3><em>Et Tu, </em>O'Brien?</h3>
<p>Winston's strengths lie in his unwavering individuality and the accompanying fervent rebelliousness. Seriously, even just keeping his journal is enough to warrant a death sentence—the dude's brave. Being with <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/julia"">Julia</a> brings out even more of the rebel within him, which is why they're a match made in rebel heaven.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, combined with his penchant for pessimism, these traits are also his downfall.</p>
<p>Winston is extremely (and deservingly) paranoid, and his overriding belief that the Party will ultimately catch and punish him becomes gospel. We're gonna go out on a limb and guess it has something to do with all those BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU posters. Believing that he is helpless in evading his fate, Winston takes unnecessary risks, and is eventually <span class=""wtf"" data-wtf=""5B5D52286D4D46F1A9A6305E17BCBDF2"">(surprise, surprise)</span> apprehended by the Thought Police.</p>
<p>And what’s up with O’Brien, the so-called Brotherhood big shot <em>and </em>Inner Party member? O’Brien seems like the guy who can do all the things Winston can’t. He’s the cool kid. So you can imagine how much it stings for O’Brien to be the one that screws Winston over at the end. What can we say—these bros ain't loyal. Talk about the ultimate betrayal. It’s a tragic element that douses the <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/themes/rebellion"">rebellious sparkle</a> in Winston's eyes for good. </p>
<h3>Big Brother <em>Was </em>Watching, After All</h3>
<p>Throughout the story, we follow Winston's blossoming from a meek everyman to a determined and impassioned rebel. He's our protagonist, and we're rooting for him all the way. Maybe he really <em>can</em> escape the <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/themes/power"">Party's grip</a>; maybe he and Julia really <em>do</em> have a future together.</p>
<p>Wait—who are we kidding? This is the <em>future</em>. Everything sucks in the future. So, like a bag of chips stuck in a vending machine, Orwell comes back around to ruin our day (Week? Month?) when Winston is captured, tortured, and <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/themes/manipulation"">brainwashed</a>.</p>
<p>What's worse? The brainwashing is a success. He betrays Julia while being tortured and comes out feeling nothing but benevolent love for <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/analysis/symbolism-imagery-allegory"">Big Brother</a>. The Winston we grew to love is dead and gone. It's shocking, but effective. With this ending, Orwell sends a powerful message about the extent to which totalitarian rule can kill the human spirit—a warning to us all.</p>

0,Julia,https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/1984/julia,"<div data-appearance=""default"" data-content-type=""text"" data-element=""main""><h2 class=""title"">Julia</h2>
<h3>Love is All You Need</h3>
<p><span class=""wtf"" data-wtf=""CC587812017F48F7AD55A6E62628699E"">Julia is <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/winston-smith"">Winston Smith</a>'s Juliet. Is the name a coincidence? Probably not.</span> A duplicitous and whimsical creature, her sexual allure inspires Winston to start the rebellious writings (because he fantasizes about her). She then acts as Winston’s ally in active <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/themes#rebellion-theme"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">rebellion</a>, although her idea of revolt is more in-your-arms than up-in-arms. Julia is a dark-haired, twenty-six-year-old employed as a machine operator in the Fiction Department at the Ministry of Truth. Looking like a zealous Party member, she wears an (ironic) <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/analysis/symbolism-imagery-allegory"">Anti-Sex sash</a> around her waist, and always participates passionately during the Two Minutes Hate.</p>
<div style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.shmoop.com/1984/chart-julia.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazyload"" data-src=""https://media1.shmoop.com/images/chart/1984-julia.png"" src=""data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%221%22%20height%3D%221%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%20225%20265%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E"" style=""width: 75%; height: auto;""/></a>

</div>
<p>Julia’s other side is much more interesting. She is a woman with raging hormones and a cunning spirit. A highly sexual being, she sleeps with Party members regularly to satisfy her own desires. Does she really mean it as <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/themes/rebellion"">rebellion</a>, or does she just want to get it on? You could argue either way. Winston would sure like it to be the former, and Julia does suggest that her acts are her own small rebellion. But still, she is generally uninterested in fighting the good fight. In fact, the reason she approached Winston with the ""I love you"" note was probably to start yet another illicit affair. She busies herself with community service and other orthodox activities so that she can escape the Party’s thoughtcrime radar. <span class=""wtf"" data-wtf=""D0FB4F75C64B48BF9E4A784FCA35B468"">Clever gal.</span></p>
<h3>Not So Happily Ever After</h3>
<p>When Julia and Winston fall in love, they commit the biggest possible offense against the Party because of the newly constructed, shared, private loyalty to one another. Supposedly, if you love a person, you have less love left to give to the Party. We’re thinking the Beatles would come in handy about now, but the Thought Police would have our heads for that. </p>
<p>The moment Winston and Julia are captured signifies the importance of their bond. So what does it mean that the two betray each other? Perhaps that love is weak and feeble in the face of, um, rats. Or that, ultimately, people value themselves and their own safety more highly than their loved one. Or…you come up with one.</p></div>"
0,O'Brien,https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/1984/obrien,"<div data-appearance=""default"" data-content-type=""text"" data-element=""main""><h2 class=""title"">O'Brien</h2>
<p><br/>O’Brien is a total mystery. This novel raises more questions about O’Brien than it answers. An <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/themes/power"">Inner Party member</a> and a large, burly man with a thick neck and a brutal face, he wears black overalls, which we think are supposed to give him an authoritative air. He is about forty-years-old, and <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/winston-smith"">Winston</a> has an intellectual crush on him. Why? O’Brien has privileges that Winston doesn’t. If he is a member of the rebellious Brotherhood, as Winston believes, then <span class=""wtf"" data-wtf=""1E21D5E8EBFD499BADF2D6F7465836C3"">he also has balls that Winston doesn’t.</span> (If Winston is afraid to act, then O’Brien, or at least Winston’s conception of O’Brien, is a gutsier version of our protagonist.)</p>

</div>
<p><br/>A powerful and cunning man, O’Brien tricks Winston into believing that he is a member of the anti-Party Brotherhood. He is completely duplicitous. O’Brien approaches and inducts Winston into the group, but does that in order to set Winston up for the ultimate crime. Later, O’Brien even runs the show on Winston’s <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/themes/violence"">torturing</a>. Talk about betrayal. At one point, he tells Winston that the Party had captured him <em>himself</em> a long time ago. Was O’Brien at one point rebellious, just like Winston? Who knows. We don’t really trust anything this guy says anymore. This is still a fascinating line, however. We don’t know if O’Brien was once rebellious, and, quite frankly, it doesn’t matter. Just as Winston comments that once a person is erased from history, he ceases to have ever existed, so once a person is converted, he ceases to have ever been a rebel. The ambiguity of O’Brien’s former role is more poignant than if we knew for sure that O’Brien used to be a rebel.Lastly, O’Brien’s character really hits home with this dual, conflicting emotions business. It starts with Julia, right? Winston both hates and wants to screw her. Similarly, throughout the text, Winston both admires and hates O’Brien. He also both loves and despises the Inner Party and, actually, Big Brother in general. ""What is going on"", you say? We direct you to the <span class=""wtf"" data-wtf=""0683EAF1F2AF49829EE5865DFDA2F9EE"">lovely little passage</span> in the opening chapter that says, ""<a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/themes/manipulation"">War is Peace; Freedom is Slavery; and Ignorance is Strength.</a>"" It’s almost as if we, the reader, get the same confusing and conflicting information that Winston does. It’s almost like we experience the same emotions and terror.</p></div>"

<p>Mr. Charrington is an old widower with a cockney accent who keeps a secondhand store in the Prole district. He sells Winston the journal he starts in <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/summary/book-1-chapter-1"">Book One</a>, and rents out the room atop that same store to Winston and Julia in Book Two. Kind and amiable, Mr. Charrington shares Winston’s interest in the past, and chats with him about antiques and other remnants. Mr. Charrington shares with Winston his knowledge about certain items, but never asks any questions.</p>

<p><span class=""wtf"" data-wtf=""3D5C39D67F6047A39CA34BC955CD16DA"">But alas!</span> As you might have discovered by now, Mr. Charrington is not as he seems. Cold, alert, and about thirty-five years of age (as opposed to the jovial, 60-year-old, wrinkly, bushy-eyebrowed, bespectacled widower Winston thought him to be), he is actually a member of the <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/themes/manipulation"">Thought Police</a>. The dude is basically an undercover agent for the Party whose job is to sniff out subversive citizens.<br/><br/>What’s the point of Mr. Charrington? He illustrates the ‘""just when you thought you were safe"" mantra we seem to have adopted since beginning <em><a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984"">1984</a></em>. He emphasizes the themes of betrayal, deception, and all around brutality that are woven through the text.</p></div>"

<p>OK, so the proles are really a group of people, but they function with the importance of a single character. In fact, they all around seem like one, collective character because they’re not singled out as individuals. That’s the point of the proles – they’re just a nameless, mindless mass.</p>

<p>So now it seems odd, doesn’t it, that Winston envies them as the only free and human beings left? They’re not smart, they’re ignorant, and they’re basically just workers – <em>but they’re happy</em>. They’re happy and human because they are not subject to the same scrutiny and control that <a href=""/study-guides/literature/1984/winston-smith"">Winston</a> and his peers are.<br/><br/>Now, why don’t the proles overthrow <span class=""wtf"" data-wtf=""702E6792A54B4428A98831FA83DE56FF"">the power-hungry government</span> in a massive coup?

1,Professor Pierre Aronnax,https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/20000-leagues-under-the-sea/professor-pierre-aronnax,"<div data-appearance=""default"" data-class=""SHCharacter"" data-content-type=""text"" data-element=""main""><h2 class=""title"">Professor Pierre Aronnax</h2><h3>Professor Arrogance</h3><p>Ever notice how close the name <em>Aronnax</em> is to <em>arrogance</em>? Well, we don't think that's an accident. Pierre Aronnax is billed as a scientist's scientist, a Professor of Marine Biology who lectures at hoity-toity European museums. But the dude begins <em>20,000 Leagues </em>by claiming that the creature currently terrorizing the world's oceans is a giant narwhal. Boy, is he wrong. </p><p>So, our introduction to Aronnax isn't exactly flattering. He thinks he knows <em>everything</em>, but he misses a lot. And he gets kinda agitated when other people seem to surpass his own capabilities.</p><p>For example, Professor Arrogance didn't build any submarines. And when he boards the <em>Nautilus</em>, he's very suspicious of how Captain Nemo could have put the thing together on his own. Sure, we admit it: it's pretty hard to imagine how Nemo could have constructed such a crazy futuristic piece of technology all by his lonesome. But Aronnax's response to the <em>Nautilus</em> <em>reeks </em>of envy and insecurity:</p><p><em>That a private individual had at his disposition a mechanical contrivance of this sort was improbable. When and where could he have had it built, and how could he have kept its construction secret? </em>(1.2.6)</p><p>Dude is really trying to save face here. Similarly, Professor Arrogance often puts the preservation of knowledge and the upholding of social norms above humanity. Like, even above his own, and others', safety. </p><p>For most of the novel, Aronnax and Ned Land engage in verbal fisticuffs about their potential escape from the <em>Nautilus</em>. Aronnax is so often paralyzed by indecision that he just sits and watches the pretty fishies swim by the sub's giant windows. And what might wrest him from his own inaction, you ask? Further self-absorption, of course: </p><p><em>We had not been made to break with humanity. For my part, I did not wish my intriguing and original studies to be buried with me. </em>(1.18.7)</p><p>Ah, now here's the <em>real</em> reason Aronnax must return to land: if he doesn't, no one will ever laud him for all of the fantastic discoveries he made aboard the <em>Nautilus</em>. </p><p>We're guessing that you're also wondering why our <a href=""https://www.shmoop.com/literature-glossary/protagonist.html"" target=""_blank"">protagonist</a> seems so darn obsessed with people's nationalities. At least with Nemo, this shtick kind of makes sense, because Aronnax is trying to figure out how his Captain ended up so ragey. So Aronnax thinks deep thoughts like, ""Would I ever know to what nation this strange man belonged, that boasted of belonging to none?"" (1.14.24). </p><p>But that's not the whole story, is it? Clearly, Aronnax's got a lot of national pride. He gets all excited when other people can speak his language, and he's evidently a little disappointed that the ol' harpooner is French<em>-Canadian</em>—a.k.a, <em>not the real (French) deal</em>. Plus, when the group gets into a little fracas with those cannibals, Aronnax seems less concerned with getting eaten alive than he is with acting like a good European should: </p><p><em>I could easily have shot this native, within close range, but I believed it better to wait for really hostile behaviour. When dealing with savages, it is better for the Europeans to riposte, rather than attack first. </em>(1.22.39)</p><p>In part, Aronnax's obsessive nationalism is a product of Verne's times. But it also furthers the book's theme of the questionable defensibility of violence; is there <em>any </em>backstory Aronnax could dream up for Nemo that'd justify Nemo's killings? What do you think Aronnax is trying to justify by obsessively focusing on his and others' nationalities?</p><h3>The Little Pedant Who Couldn't</h3><p>The Professor is what you might call a <a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pedant"" target=""_blank"">pedant</a>. He loves to shows off all of his book smarts, often at the cost of missing really obvious stuff that's going on in the world around him. Like the fact that Nemo is a scary, vengeful wacko. </p><p>Really, it's kind of astounding that he doesn't put some of Nemo's puzzle pieces together till the end of the book. The truth is, he doesn't see Nemo for what he is—crazy—because <em>he doesn't want to</em>. Sure, Aronnax is suspicious of the guy. Early on, Aronnax says this of Nemo:</p><p><em>I saw the enigmatic individual as essentially pitiless and cruel, as he was forced to be. I felt him as being beyond the pale of humanity, insensible to feelings of pity, the remorseless enemy of his fellow beings, against whom he must have sworn an undying hatred. </em>(1.9.63)</p><p>But Aronnax is so in love with the Captain, as a kind of pseudo-scientist rebel-man of the high seas, that he totally romanticizes him as well: </p><p><em>Was he one of those unrecognized scientists, one of those geniuses 'who had been hurt' to use Conseil's expression, a modern Galileo; or he was he one of those scientists […] whose career was ruined by a political revolution? </em>(1.14.24)</p><p>Contradictions, much?</p><p>Now, it's easy to feel for Aronnax. Nemo has helped all of Aronnax's wildest scientific dreams come true—and more. While aboard the <em>Nautilus</em>, he's got a quiet study, an awesome library, and an unbeatable window into the undersea world. </p><p>But Aronnax has gotten himself into quite a pickle. Even before the whole ""this-nut-kills-innocent-people"" issue comes up, Aronnax has qualms with the terms of his and his friends' captivity. When Aronnax argues that only a ""savage"" has the right to keep them locked away, Nemo shuts him up right away. </p><p>Aronnax spends the rest of the voyage wondering if he should submit to Nemo's rules, if he should escape, and if he even has the <em>right</em> to escape:</p><p><em>What terrible hours I spent, now seeing myself safe on land with my companions, now wishing, despite my rational side, that some unforeseen circumstance would prevent Ned's plans from unfolding. </em>(2.8.20)</p><p>All of these thoughts—and questions about Nemo's identity—swirl around in Aronnax's head like water in the Maelstrom. It takes the terrible massacre of the unidentified warship to jolt Aronnax into action. The man who claimed that Nemo ""never spills the blood of innocent creatures without good reason"" (2.14.34) is forced to admit that he might have been wrong.</p><p>As we know, this isn't the first time Aronnax has been wrong. So at least he ends the book considerably wiser than he started. And at least he knows more about the ocean now than he did, given that he's gained some <em>firsthand </em>experience. But he still probably doesn't know as much as he claims. Aronnax writes:</p><p><em>'So, to that question, which the Book of Ecclesiastes posed 6,000 years ago,' he writes, ''hast thou walked in search of the depth?', two men, amongst all men, now have the right to reply. Captain Nemo and I. </em>(2.26.6)</p><p>But while Aronnax has walked a mile in Nemo's shoes—or floated 20,000 leagues in his submarine, as it were—the sea will never be his home.

It alerts us readers to the fact that Nemo is larger than (fictionalized) life; he's not just a <em>character</em>, he's a <em><a href=""https://www.shmoop.com/literature-glossary/symbol.html"" target=""_blank"">symbol</a></em> (see our <a href=""https://www.shmoop.com/20000-leagues-under-the-sea/nemo-symbol.html"" target=""_blank"">""Symbols, Imagery, Allegory""</a> section for more information). What's he a symbol <em>of</em>, you ask?</p><p>Well, Nemo means ""no one"" in Latin. So his middle name might as well be <em>mystery</em>. Clearly, Verne wants us to be curious about Nemo's past. We empathize deeply with Aronnax's incessant questions about Nemo's true identity, because the dude's utter out-there-ness has kept us up at night, too. </p><p>At the end of the novel, when all is usually revealed, we are left only with Aronnax's remaining questions about his <a href=""https://www.shmoop.com/o-captain-my-captain/"" target=""_blank"">Captain</a>: </p><p><em>Is Captain Nemo still alive? [...] Will the waves one day wash up the manuscript containing the entire story of his life? Will I finally discover his name? Will the nationality of the vessel sunk tell us Captain Nemo's own nationality? </em>(2.23.5)</p><p>So we guess we'll have to wait 'till Nemo's tell-all comes out before we can get some darn answers around here, huh? Nah, don't give up on Verne (or us) too soon, dear Shmoopers. Maybe the important thing about Nemo <em>is</em> his enigmatic nature. </p><p>Allow us to prove it to you. First, he's a private person. He built his own special submarine just so he could be alone, away from society. He famously says: </p><p><em>I am not what you call a civilized being! I have broken with society for reasons which I alone have the right to appreciate. So I do not obey its rules, and I ask you never to invoke them in my presence again! </em>(1.10.20)</p><p>Nemo won't even surface to bury his dead crewmen. He puts them to rest in a massive undersea cemetery. Aronnax seems to think that Nemo buries the bodies under the sand so that they will be ""out of the reach of sharks."" But Captain Nemo wryly points out that it isn't just the sharks he's worried about; in this cemetery, his dead men will be safe from both ""sharks and men!"" (1.24.76-7).</p><p>In <em>20,000 Leagues</em>, we never do learn where that warship at the end of the novel was from. Or if Nemo was actually an American Civil War veteran. The fact is, no man (or woman)—us readers included—can get the truth out of him. And this mystery is precisely what allows Nemo to become <em>more </em>than a man in <em>20,000 Leagues</em>.</p><p>But if you're dying to know more, read Verne's <em>The Mysterious Island. </em>We won't give away the whole story, but the Civil War question is settled, and it's revealed that Nemo's an Indian Prince. It's safe to say that with this new knowledge, he's <em>still</em> not your average gent. </p><h3>Captain Nemo: Larger Than Life</h3><p>After Nemo destroys the mystery battleship near the end of the novel, Aronnax notes: </p><p><em>His character was accentuated and took on a superhuman dimension. He was no longer a fellow human, but a marine being, a spirit of the seas. </em>(22.37) </p><p>Aronnax doesn't mean Nemo's a <em>superhero</em>. Although, he would become one in <em><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311429/?ref_=sr_2"" target=""_blank"">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a></em>. Come to think of it, he also shares some similarities with <a href=""http://www.dccomics.com/characters/aquaman"" target=""_blank"">Aquaman</a>, who, depending on whom you ask, may or may not be the son of Nemo. </p><p>Anyway, Aronnax is really pointing out that Nemo's more <em>myth</em>—more <em>story</em>, more <em>gossip</em>—than <em>man</em>. And this larger-than-life image of Mr. Nemo wouldn't hold water (hilarious, we know) if we knew some more real facts about Nemo's life. </p><p>Like, if we were to learn that Nemo was actually from Cleveland, Ohio, where he's got a wife and two kids waiting for him to come home, he wouldn't seem so special after all. In order to be <em>No One</em>, Nemo has to be a kind of an <em><a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman"" target=""_blank"">everyman</a></em>.</p><p>Considering his position outside—and maybe even ""above""—mankind, it's not so surprising that Nemo makes proclamations like ""I am the law, I am the justice!"" (21.59). In the end, he's a man who's lost his country, his family, and his old identity. </p><p>There's no use digging into Nemo's past because by the time we meet him, his past has become sort of irrelevant. Now, he's simply <em>Nemo</em>, <em>No One</em>, a maritime ball o' questionably-motivated violence—and nothing more.</p></div>"
1,Ned Land,https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/20000-leagues-under-the-sea/ned-land,"<div data-appearance=""default"" data-class=""SHCharacter"" data-content-type=""text"" data-element=""main""><h2 class=""title"">Ned Land</h2><h3>Looking for Land</h3><p>Hark, <em>Land</em>, ho! Another meaningful name, eh Mr. Verne? We see what you're doing here. So, Ned Land is a bit of a contradiction. He's a harpooner, a man of the sea, but his name is <em>Land</em>. And he spends most of the book trying to get back onto that dry, dirt-y stuff. </p><p>While Aronnax aspires to lofty knowledge and greatness and all, Ned's desires are pretty basic. He likes freedom, hunting, and eating what he hunts. As we see early on, Ned classifies fish based on the way they taste. He has no time for Conseil's scientific classification gobbledygook, and he has even less patience for Aronnax's starry eyes (for the deep sea). </p><p>We'd get tired of a buddy who said things like this to us:</p><p><em>Ah, friend Ned, are you already tired of our journey under the seas? Are you already blasé about this constantly changing spectacle of submarine marvels? For my part, I would be most upset to come to the end of this voyage which so few men have had the chance to make. (2.4.13) </em></p><p>To be honest, Ned has been ready to peace the heck outta the <em>Nautilus </em>since day one. There's really very little to satisfy Ned's desires inside of a stupid electric submarine. Aronnax and Conseil are sort of compensated for their imprisonment because they have the chance to look at all sorts of undersea animals and other outlandish phenomena. </p><p>But Ned… well, Ned gets to kill a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YProaycNpHE"" target=""_blank"">dugong</a> and shoot some kangaroos. As Aronnax says to Nemo:</p><p><em>For me, study is a support, a powerful diversion, an absorption, a passion which can help me forget everything. For Ned, not so much, and there's nothing on board the Nautilus to fill that hole. </em>(1.19.59)</p><h3>A Straight-Shootin' Soul</h3><p>Now, don't go thinking that Ned's a totally sad sack. He's capable of amazing acts of bravery. He saves Nemo from a killer shark, and puts his life on the line to take down a killer squid. </p><p>He's simply—and this may come as a shock—too sensitive, and too used to living on land, to enjoy himself on the <em>Nautilus</em>. By the end of the book, he's on the verge of suicide, and it's only an act of daring that frees him from Nemo's grasp… And the clutches of the ever-frightening Maelstrom (a.k.a. the Whirlpool of Doom).</p><p>Finally, it's important to note that, according to Aronnax, Land is both French-Canadian <em>and</em> American. He speaks English and French with equal ease, and seems to be both typically Anglo-Saxon and classically French. So, in stark contrast to Aronnax and Nemo's staunch nationalism, this guy's kind of a melting pot. </p><p>Ned's multiple nationalities speak to his general level-headedness. Ned believes in what he <em>sees </em>(with that absolutely perfect vision of his), not what he reads in stuffy old books, unlike Professor Arrogance—er, Aronnax. Land is the <em>doer </em>to Aronnax's <em>thinker</em>. </p><p>To be sure, Ned is the one who keeps Aronnax from totally going off the deep end (har har) along with Nemo. He's Aronnax's <a href=""https://www.shmoop.com/literature-glossary/foil.html"" target=""_blank"">foil</a>. (See our <a href=""https://www.shmoop.com/20000-leagues-under-the-sea/protagonist-antagonist.html"" target=""_blank"">""Character Roles""</a> section for more on the antagonistic relationship between these two characters.)</p></div>"
1,Conseil,https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/20000-leagues-under-the-sea/conseil,"<div data-appearance=""default"" data-class=""SHCharacter"" data-content-type=""text"" data-element=""main""><h2 class=""title"">Conseil</h2><p>Okay, guys, let's get the obvious out of the way first. Conseil means <em>counsel</em>, in French, which is pretty ironic. This guy is basically in the book to <em>serve</em> his master, Aronnax (and be his trusty life-saver, we might add). He would never deign to <em>advise</em> his master. </p><p>And, as you may have noticed, Conseil <em>really</em>, really loves Aronnax. His dedication to the guy, at the cost of his own survival instincts, makes us kind of uncomfortable, actually. Conseil just seems to think whatever his master thinks, and do whatever his master does. </p><p>There are plenty of examples of Conseil's servile behavior. Like how he jumps in after Aronnax when he's thrown overboard, and helps him survive, even though Aronnax is pretty much whining like a little baby the whole time.</p><p>But there's more to our boy Conseil than meets the eye. Beneath Conseil's loyal shell, and beyond his impressive, obsessive, bizarre ability to classify animals and plants—fish that he requires Aronnax to recognize first—lies a strange core. </p><p>Sometimes, Conseil's deficiencies are funny. Like when he can't believe that cod don't look like the filleted, gutted things you see in the fish market. Or when he decides to eat the fish that stings him ""out of revenge,"" even though it tastes <em>awful</em>. But other times, they reveal a passion you wouldn't expect to find in a man who sometimes acts like a robot. </p><p>Take his reaction to the cannibal attack. On the one hand, he seems, how do we say this, non-judgmental. Sure, he compares savages to monkeys—you can't really forgive that little bit o' racism—but he also makes some surprisingly insightful statements. When Aronnax suggests that the ""savages"" must be ""bad"" because they're cannibals, Conseil replies:</p><p><em>One can be a cannibal and a good man […] just as one can be a glutton and honest. The one does not exclude the other. </em>(1.22.46)</p><p>However, shortly after making this remark, Conseil nearly shoots one of the cannibals because a stone he's thrown breaks a rare shell. So we guess one can be kind of a thoughtful person and a master-serving oddball? </p><p>Above all, Conseil will always be Aronnax's loyal servant. But Conseil's eccentricities show us that there is more to this man who spends most of his time doing his master's bidding. He's not a one-dimensional dude. </p></div>"
1,The Crew of the Nautilus,https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/20000-leagues-under-the-sea/nautilus-crew,"<div data-appearance=""default"" data-class=""SHCharacter"" data-content-type=""text"" data-element=""main""><h2 class=""title"">The Crew of the Nautilus</h2><p>Four words: ""Nautron respoc lorni virch."" What's it mean? We don't know… and that's the point. The crew of the <em>Nautilus</em> is a total mystery. </p><p>They speak an unidentifiable language. Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil can't even figure out how many of them are on board. Like Nemo, they do nothing to reveal their nationalities. Well, almost nothing. </p><p>Just once, in the horrible battle against the squid, when an unlucky sailor is snatched up, he screams out for help <em>in French</em>. Aronnax knows, then, that these men are, well, men—he feels a sort of fellowship with this countryman he barely knows. </p><p>This little slip-up gives us a bit more evidence that Nemo and his crew are really human beings. While they're sort of mythic and mysterious, they're also regular people who are just trying to live their lives, forget the past, and start anew.</p></div>"

That mission? Destroy the ""giant narwhal."" As Aronnax tells us, the American captain had one thing on his mind: </p><p><em>Either [he] would kill the narwhal or the narwhal would kill [him]. There could be no middle course. </em>(1.4.1)</p><p>In the end, Farragut has to take that middle course. But his failure is not for lack of trying. He's simply outclassed by the <em>Nautilus</em>, unable to do anything to counter Nemo's mechanical monster. </p></div>"
2,David Bowman,https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/2001-a-space-odyssey/david-bowman,"<div data-appearance=""default"" data-class=""SHCharacter"" data-content-type=""text"" data-element=""main""><h2 class=""title"">David Bowman</h2><h3>David Bowman, Nobody</h3><p>Characterization doesn't matter much in <em>2001</em>. You can see this in part in the way the novel skips lightly from main protagonist to main protagonist: Moon-Watcher's the hero of the first part; Heywood Floyd of the second part; and David Bowman of the rest—which means you don't actually meet the ostensible main character until more than a third of the way through the book.</p><p>This switch from character to character might be jarring in another book. But in <em>2001</em> it hardly matters, because none of the characters have a personality to speak of. This is certainly true of Bowman, whose main trait seems to be that he is careful to not have any traits. There are several points in the book where he seems like he's going to have an emotion, or a reaction, and he pulls back instantly into bland, spaceman competence. </p><p>After Hal kills everyone on the ship, Bowman is at first sort of moderately upset (""I suppose you're pretty broken up about it"" Hal comments (26.7)) but then he just goes back to doing his job, like he's the automaton rather than the ship's captain: ""Work is the best remedy for any shock, and Bowman now had work enough for all his lost crewmates,"" (31.1) is all the explanation the novel gives us for how Bowman is able to shrug off the death of his friend and his own forthcoming demise. Later, when Bowman has been zipped miraculously across the galaxy, only to discover the alien race he hoped to meet is (he thinks) dead, he barely blinks:</p><p><em>Well, it was unreasonable to expect more. Already he had seen wonders for which many men would have sacrificed their lives.</em> (42.22-23) </p><p>This goes beyond level-headed and towards catatonic. Bowman is a tranquilized nonentity. He is calm, not because he is a person whose psychology is calm, but because he has no psychology, and isn't really a fully fleshed out character. He's just a way to watch the exciting space events unfold. It's like every time Bowman might react, Clarke reaches down out of space and taps him on the shoulder to remind him that nobody cares about his reactions. ""Just watch the double-sun, buddy,"" Clarke seems to be telling him. ""Save the emoting for some other book.""</p><h3>David Bowman, Everybody</h3><p>Part of the reason Bowman is so bland is because he doesn't matter. But part of the reason is that he's supposed to matter transcendentally. He's not one person because he's the whole human race. In this sense, he and Moon-Watcher and Floyd are all one. They're all part of the great progress from the earth to the moon to the solar system to the stars.</p><p>You can see this most clearly at the very end of the novel, when the aliens are messing with Bowman's brain and rewinding his experiences. You zip back through the book, there's Saturn, there's the last talk with Hal, there's poor murdered Frank Poole. And then you go further back…but you still don't find out anything specific about Bowman. It's all generic; he could be anybody:</p><p><em>Faster, faster he moved back into forgotten years, and into a simpler world. Faces he had once loved, and had thought lost beyond recall, smiled at him sweetly.</em> (45.9) </p><p>Who are those faces? Well, you can fill in the blank. They're faces <em>you</em> know, or they might as well be. Bowman has no particular experiences to get in the way. He's a more boring you.</p><p>This means that at the end, when Bowman turns into a space baby, you could be turning into that space baby too. The New Age, quasi-religious future faith in evolutionary apotheosis is for everybody. It is not just Bowman, but the human race, that is destined for great things. It is not just Bowman who will become an awesome energy critter—you will too.</p><p>Bowman is not really meant to be a person with feelings and emotions and character development. He doesn't undergo internal development and learn stuff, because if he did that it would distract from the magic transformation into the space baby. You can't be a human being and a space baby both, and the novel, by far, prefers space babies.</p></div>"
2,Hal,https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/2001-a-space-odyssey/hal,"<div data-appearance=""default"" data-class=""SHCharacter"" data-content-type=""text"" data-element=""main""><h2 class=""title"">Hal</h2><h3>The Imperfect Computer</h3><p>Hal, the <em>Discovery</em>'s computer, is easily the most entertaining character in the book. Supposedly he's an unfeeling hunk of metal, but in reality, he's the only one in the novel who really seems to feel much of anything, or to act as if he feels much of anything. Bowman, Poole, Floyd, even Moon-Watcher all go about their business efficiently, setting goals and pursuing them. They may make tactical errors (like Moon-Watcher dragging the kill to the cave without realizing it would bring the leopard) but jealousy, pride, or other petty emotions don't distract them. They don't, in short, seem to have a subconscious. Everything for each of them is on the surface.</p><p>Not Hal, though. On the surface, Hal is an efficient, cheerful, friendly data-cruncher, always at the ready, always with the team, just like the rest of the other numbingly boring bureaucrats who surround him. He assures Bowman, saying:</p><p><em>You know that I have the greatest possible enthusiasm for this mission.</em> (24.43)</p><p>And:</p><p><em>My onboard memory is quite capable of handling all the mission requirements</em>. (26.23)</p><p>Okay, cool, so there's a big talking computer on board. So what? </p><p>Well, beneath all that efficiency is a delightfully neurotic, homicidal mess. ""Look, Dave, you've got a lot of things to do. I suggest you leave this to me,"" (26.30) Hal says, by which he means he's going to kill all the people in hibernation. Hal's a sneaky supervillain; he's cunning and deceitful; you can't trust what he says.</p><p>And that's what makes him seem so human. Bowman always says what he means; Floyd sometimes lies, but always in the interest of the greater good. Hal has a bit of him that <em>isn't</em> just about the mission. He's got a goal that isn't the goal of the novel; that's all his own. Bowman doesn't even seem to fear death, but Hal does:<br/><em><br/>Dave…I don't understand why you're doing this to me…I have the greatest enthusiasm for the mission…You are destroying my mind…Don't you understand?...I will become childish…I will become nothing….</em> (28.47) </p><p>The novel for the most part only expresses the emotions of awe and wonder, but with Hal's death, it, for once, manages real sadness.</p><h3>The Imperfect Human</h3><p>So why is the crazed computer the only one in the book who seems recognizably human? A big part of it is that the book is about progress—and Hal is the one big blip in the progress. Hal is a technology that doesn't work and messes up; he's the non-human brain that gets homicidal and evil, rather than (like the Star Baby) powerful and beneficent. Hal doesn't strive for the stars; instead, when he's supposed to strive for the stars, he decides it's more important for him to stay alive. He's retrograde in the path of advancement. He's going backwards while the rest of the book is going forwards.</p><p>And that makes him human. The book is all about progressing beyond meat and flesh and worries about death and turning into super star people who know all and see all and are, as a result, really boring. Hal feels backwards—and backwards, in this book, is the only way to feel human at all. Hal is not with the program, he does not, in fact, feel enthusiasm for the mission. Unlike all the other aliens in the book, Hal is flawed. And flaws are what make you human. </p></div>"
2,Moon-Watcher,https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/2001-a-space-odyssey/moon-watcher,"<div data-appearance=""default"" data-class=""SHCharacter"" data-content-type=""text"" data-element=""main""><h2 class=""title"">Moon-Watcher</h2><p>In the novel, you first see the man-ape Moon-Watcher disposing of the body of his dad, and feeling very little about it. After Moon-Watcher dumps his dad for the jackals:</p><p><em>He never thought of his father again.</em> (1.10)</p><p>And that more or less sums up Moon-Watcher. He's more interesting to spend time with than Bowman, because man-apes are more interesting than bureaucrats. But fundamentally, there's not much to Moon-Watcher. You're told he's ""almost a giant"" (1.6) among his people, and that he's a ""genius."" (4.16) But as far as inner life goes, he doesn't have much of one. He tries to find food; he tries to survive. And then the slab lands and pokes him to hope for a better life, which means using tools to get more food and killing the rival man-apes when he has the chance. But as far as what makes Moon-Watcher particularly Moon-Watcher, or how he's different than the other man-apes (other than being bigger and stronger)—you don't learn anything about that.</p><p>You could argue that man-apes don't really have an inner-life; that one man-ape is much like the other. But, that rather ignores the fact that David Bowman and Heywood Floyd don't have much in the way of inner lives either. Moon-Watcher is just like them—he might as well be them. His eyes are set on the stars, and those eyes set on the stars are about all that the book cares about. Human or man-ape, all that matters is that you're going to evolve into something else. What you do in the meantime while you're waiting to evolve doesn't matter, and as far as the novel is concerned, doesn't even really exist. The novel says: </p><p><em>Now he was master of the world, and he was not quite sure what to do next.</em> (6.11)</p><p>But really it's the novel itself that doesn't know what to do next. Mastery and power and progress are the whole deal; beyond that, the novel has little interest in describing what people (or man-apes) might want, or feel. </p></div>"
2,Aliens,https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/2001-a-space-odyssey/aliens,"<div data-appearance=""default"" data-class=""SHCharacter"" data-content-type=""text"" data-element=""main""><h2 class=""title"">Aliens</h2><p>The aliens aren't exactly characters—but then, other than Hal, there aren't very many convincing characters in the book anyway. David Bowman, Moon-Watcher, and Heywood Floyd all stand in for ""humanity"" more or less. By the same token, the aliens stand in for ""God"", or ""evolution""—or, possibly, for Arthur C. Clarke himself. The novel says, ""in all the galaxy, they [the aliens] had found nothing more precious than Mind"" (37.5)—which tells you pretty clearly what the book sees as important. The aliens cultivate mind; they make the brains that go from earth to the moon to space. </p><p>Those brains are mostly indistinguishable, whether they belong to Moon-Watcher or Bowman. The aliens want minds, not hearts or souls. As disconnected intelligences, without bodies or personalities, they seem to sum up the kind of characterization the book sees as ideal. They are the non-characters who sum up the non-characterization that characterizes the book. The aliens are nobody, and, the book seems to say, if humans evolve just right, all of them will be nobody too. Um…yay?</p></div>"

There's a passing reference to his deceased wife, some mention of kids, and a passing memory of a previous summer. But mostly you learn he's a bureaucrat and a scientist and that he's good at keeping bureaucratic, scientific secrets. Really, he's just a convenient point of view through which the reader can get to the moon and be impressed by TMA-1. Floyd's a foil for a slab. 'Nuff said. </p></div>"
